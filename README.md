Automatic Cell Tracking and Categorisation for Microscopic Image Analysis
=============

To contribute to homeostasis, protective immunity and pathology, leukocytes (white blood cells) have to be able to move between organs and within tissues. Recent advances in fluorescent reporter technology and light microscopy have provided better images than ever before of the location and behaviour of leukocytes in complex 3D environments and also within different tissues in intact living organisms. However, a significant bottleneck in converting these images into interpretable data is their reliable analysis. Fluorescently labelled cells must be tracked through time-lapse image-series data of varying contrast. Often the most effective way to do this is labour intensively and manually, however, this seriously limits the number of cells that we are able to analyse (and thus the conclusions that may be drawn). It would already be a major advance to be able to reliably automatically identify and track cells over time in sometimes noisy complex images. Adding the ability to categorise and filter the cells based on “behaviour” e.g. shape, intensity, velocity would allow us to ask and answer new mechanistic questions.

The goal of this individual project is to develop methods for cell tracking and categorisation. The implementation will be done in Matlab

This is a joint project with Dr. Leo Carlin from the Leukocyte Biology Section at the National Heart and Lung Institute (NHLI).
