Cell tracker (1 week work minimum - 3 weeks maximum):
	☐	59) Basic linear interpolation of tracklets so that I can compute quality metrics
	☐	60) List a few simple tracking metrics to compute
	☐	39) Implement cell tracking quality metrics (reqs: T59)
	☐	25) Train ANN and NB with much more data, possibly of all different datasets combined (reqs: T26)
	☐	40) Render getTrackletHeadTailDescriptors fully obsolete
	☐	34) Solve the unbalanced learning sets problem
	☐	43) Feature linker: tracklet purity (number of gaps within the track (sum and difference for both tracklet))
	☐	47) The cellIndex is uneccessary information in I, it's included in tracklets already and accessible with remaining data of I
	☐	48) Lean a linker model for each of the possible closing gaps, because otherwise I connect gaps prematurely
	☐	17) Correctly estimate then number of missedetections of the detector
	☐	29) Run data through PCA or other first
	☐	41) Linker could rely on 'average/median' descriptor for matching, instead of just the tail or head. First remove outliers, them compute average or median (if neeeded just of a few frames)
	☐	33) Best feature subset analysis
	☐	7) Skip blurred frames, and leave an annotation that you skipped a frame (reqs: S4)
	☐	42) Feature linker: Overlapp area of broadened gaussians
	☐	43) Feature linker: Distance of interpolated tracklets to midpoint
	☐	44) Feature linker: Add length of tracklets (difference or such) so that it learn that short tracklets are hard to guess
	☐	45) (extendend?) Kalman filter to predict direction
  ☐ 51) Use a kalman filter to refine position and size of its direction responses and estimate their velocities (everywhere I use velocity)
	☐	52) Do not add as negative examples tracklets that are at very similar x-y coordinates, because it might be an actual continuations should a cell be visible in between the tracklets
	☐	52) Make the thresold for robust tracklet linking load from a config files
	☐	53) To prevent unsafe robust tracklet, do not link them if there is a similiar strong link to another tracklet (define another threshold)
	☐ 57) Add a boolean feature if the distance apart < 50pixels, or < 100 pixels, etc.(not too many)	 --- should be relative to cell size relative to image width
	☐	58) Uknown values in feature computation: Make then NaN, and then replace with the mean value, or first try learning with only rows without NaNs.
Writing thesis (4 weeks work minimum - 7 weeks maximum):
	☐	3) Analyse headings of the cell_detector part
	☐	5) Review past best dissertations for section and writing style inspiration
	☐	6) cell_detection introduction
	☐	9) Compare performance with different features
	☐	10) Try the performance of the tool with added noise to data
	☐	11) Train classifier on just the single dataset vs all datasets
	☐	13) linker classifier feautres
	☐	14) gaussian broadening feature
Evaluations (2 week minimum - 3 weeks maximum):
	☐ Evaluations of detector with single type of cells (red/green)
	☐ Evaluations of tracker with single type of cells (red/green)
	☐ Evaluations of detector with different number of training/testing examples
	☐ Evaluations of tracker with different number of training/testing examples
	☐ Train a compound model with cells of different images
	☐	Try the tracker effectiveness if frames are skipped: what is the max number of frames that can be skipped while still obtaining good enough tracks
Biological statics (3 days minimum - 1 week maximum):
	☐	Discover (find in prev papers) stats that might be of interest
	☐	Write a function that computes these stats
Final GUI (1 week minimum - 2 weeks maximum):
	☐	plan design/workflow on paper
	☐	Ask Leo if we also need the option to train a new model
Cell annotator (3 days work minimum - 1 week maximum):
	☐ 2) Copy anotations over
	☐ 3) Copy links over
	☐ 5) New tab/window that displays the tracklets in 3d
	☐ 6) Elimintate uncessary filters
	☐ 7) Colormap: change marker colors for best visibility
	☐ 8) Help window
	☐ 11) Menu bar for basic tools (load dets...)
	☐ 12) Show dots should only toggle annotation dots
	☐	13) Add a button show generated tracks to complement show links
Cell detector (3 days work minimum - 1 week maximum):
	☐ If any detector NaN, in the end don't show average NaN.
	☐ Read Pylon stuff
	☐ New features to try:
		☐ Histeq + Laplacian(0.2) creates empty places in maximums, noise everywhere else
		☐ use the builtin canny edge detector, with params 0.6+
		☐	Contrast + Log 3 creates empties indised cell, dinstinct border, rest hight noise
	☐	Make it clear in the headers of the files which belong to Arteta, which have some of my changes, which are completely mine
	☐	Detect cells in all datasets (reqs: T6)
Cell stabilizer (0 week minimum - 2 weeks maximum):
	☐	1) Read how to easily do image stabilization in matlab (instaed of SIFT, RANSAC, homography, etc, which might take too long)
	☐	2) Eliminate all detected cells from the images and extract sifts of the remaining regions (or extract sifts everywhere, elimintae those close to the detected cells)
	☐	3) Given the number of SIFTs detected, or their distribution (eg only bottom part of image), it may be possible to detect bad frames. Just analyse. (reqs: S2)
	☐	4) Store the names of bad or correct frames in a file, so they can be skipped in the tracker (reqs: S3)
Approaches to solve the MAP problem of connecting tracklets:
	☐ Hungarian algorithm (cannot handle division)
	☐ Linear programming (handles division)
	☐ Network flow
Data flow process:
	☐ annotator: IN: any, OUT: dots + links # I have lost Match features
	☐ detector train: IN: dots + [links], OUT: dots
	☐ detector test : IN: images, OUT: dots + MatchFeatures
	☐ tracker: IN: dots + Match features, OUT: robust tracklets
	☐ linker : IN: dots + robust matches, OUT: dots + links
Track evaluation metrics:
	☐	1) MOTA: Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy, calculated from the number of false alarms, missed detections, and identity switches;
	☐	2) FGTIM: Fraction of Ground Truth Instances Missed; and
	☐	3) FAPF: False Alarm Per Frame.
	☐	4) Mostly tracked trajectories (MT): The number of tracjectories that are successfully tracked for more than 80%
	☐	5) Mostly lost trajectories (ML): The number of trajectories that are tracked for less than 20%
	☐	6) Partially tracked trajectories (PT): the number of trajectories that are tracked between 20% and 80%
	☐	7) Fragmentation (FRMT): the number of times a trajectory is interrupted
	☐	8) ID switches (IDS): the number of times two trajectories switch their ID
