 ✔ Train a classifier using the demo data, to see how long it takes (P1) @done (14-05-15 21:37)
 ✔ Train a new classifier using my annotated images (P2) @done (14-05-16 14:29)
 ✔ Test arteta code in train images (P3) @done (14-05-16 14:40)
 ☐ Prepare kidney images
 ☐ Annotate subset of kidney images
 ☐ Test arteta code in kidney images
 ☐ Define a testing set, and run algorithm on it to see how well it generalizes
 ☐ Run the profiler without the concurrency features, which prevent efficient profiling
 ☐ Write down the list of features used in the classifier (P4)
 ☐ Explore how these features are implemented
 ☐ Modify the code so that these feature can be removed one by one
 ☐ Remove one useless feature
 ☐ Try other feature (SIFT, ... ) 
 ☐ play around with feature extraction to learn a classifier (like the ones used for the SVMstruct)
 ☐ play around with the MSFT detector
 ☐ read paper on SVMstruct
 ☐ Try some preprocessing steps for the segmenation maybe? O figure out new feauter for the classifier with FIJI
