	☐	M1
	☐	M2
Cell matcher:
	☐ 1) Given the detection results and the annotated links create a matrix det1 det2 [binary] indicating if the detectors match or not
	☐ 2) build a algorithm to decide if the vectors match (make sure the algorithm is good with outliers... not all descriptors will be of good quality due to high image noise). The output of the algorithm should be the probability of linking. > 0.5 link, else not.
Cell detector:
	✔ 1) detector saves more features @done (14-07-03 16:28)
	✔ 2) Run detector on an example annotated dataset to extract new descriptors @done (14-07-03 16:28)
	☐ If any detector NaN, in the end don't show average NaN.
	☐ Read Pylon stuff
	☐ New features to try:
		☐ Histeq + Laplacian(0.2) creates empty places in maximums, noise everywhere else
		☐ use the builtin canny edge detector, with params 0.6+
	☐	Make it clear in the headers of the files which belong to Arteta, which have some of my changes, which are completely mine
Cell tracker:
	☐ 1) Robust tracklets (reqs: M1, M2, D1, D2 )
	☐ 2) Start building the hypothesis matrix (just the structure)
	☐ 3) compute the remaining probabilities
		☐ link
		☐ init
		☐ term
Cell annotator:
	☐ Larger marker for detections
	☐ Copy anotations over
	☐ Copy links over
	☐ Diplay links in different colors
	☐ New tab/window that displays the tracklets in 3d
	☐ Elimintate uncessary filters
	☐ Colormap: change marker colors for best visibility
	☐ Help window
	☐ For whatever I do, I would like to have high quality data, to be able to see if algorithms work or not. For this reason, I will spend the next day or two
	☐ skip bad frames annotation
	☐ Menu bar for basic tools (load dets...)
Evaluations:
	☐ Evaluations with single type of cells (red/green)
	☐ Evaluations with different number of training/testing examples
	☐ Train a compound model with cells of different images
	☐	Try the tracker effectiveness if frames are skipped: what is the max number of frames that can be skipped while still obtaining good enough tracks
Biological statics:
	☐	Discover (find in prev papers) stats that might be of interest
Final GUI:
	☐	plan design/workflow on paper
	☐	Ask Leo if we also need the option to train a new model
Approaches to solve the MAP problem of connecting tracklets:
	☐ Hungarian algorithm (cannot handle division)
	☐ Linear programming (handles division)
	☐ Network flow
Data flow process:
	☐ annotator: IN: any, OUT: dots + links # I have lost Match features
	☐ detector train: IN: dots + [links], OUT: dots
	☐ detector test : IN: images, OUT: dots + MatchFeatures
	☐ tracker: IN: dots + Match features, OUT: robust tracklets
	☐ linker : IN: dots + robust matches, OUT: dots + links

Track evaluation metrics:
	(1) MOTA: Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy, calculated from the number of false alarms, missed detections, and identity switches;
	(2) FGTIM: Fraction of Ground Truth Instances Missed; and
	(3) FAPF: False Alarm Per Frame.
