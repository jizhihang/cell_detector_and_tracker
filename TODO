 ✔ Install dependencies for Arteta code @done (10-05-11 19:03)
 ✔ Test arteta code in given samples to learn how to use it @done (14-05-11 19:03)
 ✔ Annotate the Lung dataseth @done (14-05-12 22:47)
     ✔ Split video sequence into 2 channels @done (14-05-12 22:47)
     ✔ for each channel create a new folder @done (14-05-12 22:47)
     ✔ split the video into individual frames and save them to the folders @done (14-05-12 22:47)
 ☐ Write down how annotation is performed
 ☐ Write a function to convert the points to the required matalb format and save
 ☐ Test arteta code in my images
 ☐ DO NOT BUILD AN ANNOTATION TOOL UNTIL YOU KNOW YOU ACTUALLY USE IT
 ☐ play around with feature extraction to learn a classifier (like the ones used for the SVMstruct)
 ☐ play around with the MSFT detector
 ☐ read paper on SVMstruct
 ☐ Try some preprocessing steps for the segmenation maybe? O figure out new feauter for the classifier with FIJI
