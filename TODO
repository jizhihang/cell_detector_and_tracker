 ☐ Install dependencies for Arteta code
 ☐ Test arteta code in given samples to learn how to use it
 ☐ Test arteta code in my images
 ☐ play around with the MSFT detector
 ☐ play around with feature extraction to learn a classifier (like the ones usede for the SVMstruct)
 ☐ read paper on SVMstruct
 ☐ Try some preprocessing steps for the segmenation maybe? O figure out new feauter for the classifier with FIJI
