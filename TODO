 ✔ Run the profiler without the concurrency features, which prevent efficient profiling @done (14-05-20 09:09)
 ☐ Write down the list of features used in the classifier (P4)
 ☐ Explore how these features are implemented
 ☐ Modify the code so that these feature can be removed one by one
 ☐ Remove one useless feature
 ☐ Try other feature (SIFT, ... ) 
 ☐ read paper on SVMstruct
 ☐ Train a compound model (learned on mixed datasets) and evaluate its performance
